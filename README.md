# vuori_returns

This project is a responsive clone of the [Vuori Returns page](https://returns.narvar.com/vuoriclothing/returns/) built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React Icons**.

> ⚠️ Note: Due to limited access to Vuori's proprietary fonts and brand assets, this clone is not pixel-perfect, but it serves as a close and faithful representation of the original design and flow.
